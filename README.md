## Efficiency of the AI neural network set up

### The current neural network
- The current neural network set up is based on available programming languages.
- It has an input layer, some hidden layer, and an output layer.
- All the inputs and intermediate signals are "real number".
- The activation function is a non-linear function.
- With proper combination of the layers and activation functions, mathematically the neural network can reproduce any kind of outputs.
- The optimization of neural network is b

### The inefficiency of this setup
- The hardware is based on combinations of logic gates AND, OR, XOR and NOT. They are in no way aware of "real numbers". The concept of "real number" is not an absolute necessary intermediate step.
